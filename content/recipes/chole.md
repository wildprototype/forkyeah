##Procedure

1. If using dry chickpeas, soak them overnight in the same pot you intend to cook them in.
2. When you are ready to cook, bring the chickpeas to a boil then simmer while you proceed with the following steps.
    * Now would be a good time to start a pot of brown rice.
3. Measure the coriander, cumin and turmeric into a small dish.
4. Measure the oil into a large pot over medium heat.
5. While the oil heats, finely dice the onion.
    * Place ¼ of the onion in the small bowl.
    * Add the remaining ¾ to the oil in the large pot
6. While the onions saute:
    * Dice the fresh tomato
    * Or open the can of crushed/diced tomatoes
7. When the onions are golden, add the tomatoes
8. While the tomatoes cook:
    * Measure the garam masala, cayenne pepper and 2 tsp. Salt into the second small dish
    * Measure ½ tsp. Salt into the small bowl with the onions
    * If using dry chickpeas:
        - Remove from heat
        - Drain, but keep the liquid
    * If using canned chickpeas:
        - Open the cans now
9. Approximately 5 minutes after adding the tomatoes:
    * Add the first dish of measured spices (coriander, cumin, turmeric)
    * Stir until a thick paste forms, approx. 1 minute
    * Add the chickpeas and 2 C. of their cooking liquid
    * Add the second dish of measured spices (garam masala, cayenne, salt)
    * Stir
    * Increase heat and bring to a boil
    * Cover the pot
    * Turn heat to low
10. Simmer for 20 minutes, stirring occasionally
    * Chop the chili and ginger and add to small bowl with the onions
